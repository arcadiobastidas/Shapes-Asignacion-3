12.10 (Shape Hierarchy) Implement the Shape hierarchy shown in Fig. 11.3.  Omit the Triangle and Tetrahedron classes.
Each TwoDimensionalShape should contain read-only abstract property Area to calculate the area of the two-dimensional shape.
Each ThreeDimensionalShape should have read-only abstract properties Area and Volume to calculate the surface area and volume,
respectively, of the three-dimensional shape.  Create an app that uses an array of Shape references to objects of each concrete 
class in the hierarchy.  Display a text description of the object to which each array element refers.  
Also, in the loop that processes all the shapes in the array, determine whether each shape is a TwoDimensionalShape or a ThreeDimensionalShape. 
If a Shape is a TwoDimensionalShape, display its area.  If a shape is a ThreeDimensionalShape, display its area and volume.
